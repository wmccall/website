        I started working with programming languages in 2011 when I took my
        first Java course. I then spent the most of my time working with Java
        off and on again up until 2016 when I was formally introduced to Python
        and C#. Python quickly became my favorite language to work with because
        of its ease in prototyping and quick scripting. Most recently I have
        been using Javascript to work with React to build webpages personally
        and professionally.
